## Description

This project implements a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to view and buy research papers stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Users interact with the blockchain to execute transactions, while access to the research papers is controlled through dynamically generated, time-limited access links provided by the Pinata Cloud service.

## Features

- **View Research Papers**: Users can view research papers for a limited time.
- **Buy Research Papers**: Users can buy permanent access to research papers.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses Ethereum blockchain to manage transactions.
- **IPFS for Storage**: Research papers are stored on IPFS, ensuring decentralized storage.
- **Pinata Cloud Integration**: Utilizes Pinata for secure and time-limited access to IPFS content.

### Buying a Research Paper

1. **Select a Research Paper**: Find a paper you are interested in owning permanently.
2. **Click Buy**: Use the Buy button for the desired research paper.
3. **Confirm Transaction**: Approve the transaction in your Ethereum wallet.
4. **Permanent Access**: After purchase, you will receive a permanent link to access the research paper.

## Technologies Used
